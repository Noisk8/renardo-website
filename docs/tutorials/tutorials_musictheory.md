## Arrangement

A typical Pop Arrangement has Intro, Verses, Chorus, Bridge, Refrain, and Outro. There are different radiation of it, but that is the basics.

Common Structures for a song is as followed:

*   Intro (4 Bars)
    
*   1.Verse (8 -16 Bars) + Pre-Chorus (Optional)
    
*   Chorus (8 - 16 Bars)
    
*   2.Verse (8 - 16 Bars) + Pre-Chorus (Optional)
    
*   Chorus (8-16 Bars)
    
*   Outro (4 Bars)
    

Bars are 4 beats or beats. So 4 bars in Renardo means 16 counted as beats.

Further structures, whereas A is Verse, B is Chorus, C is Bridge:

**ABABCA** >> Verse / Chorus / Verse / Chorus / Bridge / Chorus
**AABA** >> Verse / Verse / Bridge / Verse
**ABAB** >> Verse / Chorus / Verse / Chorus (simplified version of the ABABCB)
**AAA** >> Verse / Verse / Verse

The following is an example of a song structure in common electronic music:

|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Intro** | **Break** | **Buildup** | **Drop** | **Break** | **Buildup** | **Drop** | **Outro** |
| 16 Bars | 16 Bars | 4/8/16 Bars | 16 Bars | 16 Bars | 4/8/16 Bars | 16 Bars | 16 Bars |


#### Intro

*   The Intro is pretty much anything you want it to be.
    
*   Many songs start with just the melody that is rising up.
    
*   You can even create a melodic question that is answered by the rest of the song or something of the sort.
    
*   The important thing is to not stay too long at the Intro and make it tie in quickly.
    

#### Break/Bridge

*   Less loud, less bass heavy, less instruments.
    
*   This is used to break up what the listener has paid attention to. In electronic music, you usually take out the drums and add a rising sound to the next part.
    
*   A Bridge/Break can be more powerful by adding new instruments or changing the key
    
*   Try to keep this at 8 measures or less.
    
*   The Bridge is a departure from what we’ve heard in a song, previously.
    
*   This goes for both the lyrics and the music.
    
*   Lyrically it’s an opportunity for a new perspective.
    
*   Musically, it’s a chance to offer the listener something they haven’t heard before to keep the song interesting.
    

#### Buildup

*   Goes usually from Break to Drop, can be even silence.
    
*   It creates an emotional tension in the listener, which is then dissolved in the Drop.
    

#### Drop

*   Loudest, most fun to listen to.
    
*   The moment in a dance track when tension is released and the beat kicks in. This releases an enormous energy during a song's progression.
    
*   After the momentum Buildup, the pitch rising, the tension mounting, bigger, louder, until suddenly — the Drop.
    

#### Riser

*   A Riser is just like a break except that it is arpeggiate or having some sort of buildup that is released with the next section coming in.
    
*   Usually no beat and last 8 measures or 16.
    
*   When the next part comes in, it will have a lot more energy and should be the climax of the piece.
    

#### Outro

*   This is used to resolve the song and come in for a smooth landing.
    
*   Some song’s don’t have an Outro and others have a long Outro.
    
*   You can also add a final sense by adding a Coda, or strong cadence at the end of your track.

## Chords


### Chord


In music, a chord is the simultaneous sounding of at least three different tones that can be interpreted harmonically.

We can divide chords into different types depending on how many notes they have. We can have them in:

*   Groups of two notes - called intervals or dyads
    
*   Groups of three notes - known as triad chords
    
*   Groups of four or more notes - usually called seventh chords or expanded chords
    

A triad occupies the root or first note of the scale, the third degree, and the fifth degree, with each interval being a third.

For example, the C minor scale has the notes C-D-Eb-F-G-Ab-B-C. Take the 1st, 3rd and 5th notes (C-Eb-G) to get a C to form a minor triad.

A seventh chord uses the root, 3rd, 5th, and 7th degree degrees, so a Cmin7 chord would add the Bb (C-Eb-G-Bb). C minor seventh chord.

Extended chords add the 9th, 11th, and 13th scales (the octaves of the 2nd, 4th, and 6th, respectively).


#### Inversion

If you have a chord where the lowest note is not the note the chord is named after, we call this a chord inversion. A chord inversion takes a different starting note (also called a bass note) and builds the chord from there. Chord inversions are mainly used to allow easier voice guidance through different chord progressions, especially in the bass.

Features of a chord inversion are:

*   The root note is not in the bases.
    
*   Get a smooth dynamic by rearranging the chords through changing the octave of notes to align closer to first chord, thus in versing the highest note to the bass note.
    
*   Inversion of a 5th becomes a 4th and visa verse.
    
*   Major 2nd inverted becomes a minor 7th and a minor 7th becomes a Major 2nd.
    
*   Major 6th inverted becomes a minor 3rd and a minor 3rd becomes a Major 6th.

### Chord progression


To create a nice sounding and interesting melody, you need to carefully choose how each note moves to the next note and how each note relates to the notes in its vicinity. Notes can't be too far apart, and usually you want the notes to stay within the key or related keys.

The same concept is used for harmony. Since a song usually consists of more than one chord, you need to relate each chord to the one before and after it in order for the harmonic movement to sound good and interesting. This is where a chord progression comes into play.

A chord progression is when several different chords are played one after the other.

**Dur <<>> Moll**

Major and minor form the two sides of the proverbial coin when it comes to defining the key of a song or composition. Songs are in either a major or a minor key. Sometimes more complex songs or pieces contain modulations (key changes), and we can see both major and minor keys represented in a single work. However, major and minor keys (and their correlating modes) cannot occur simultaneously, at least in tonal music.

Each piece or section of a piece must be either major or minor. You can't be both. Major and minor songs are based on their respective scales (modes). This provides information about both the content of the melody and the harmony of a piece.

In other words, songs with a major key are selected from notes found in a particular seven-note major scale (like C major or F major, etc.). Songs tuned in minor are selected from seven-part minor scales (such as C minor or F minor, etc.). In the case of minor, however, there is a super-ordinate minor scale called the natural minor, as well as two variants, each called the harmonic and melodic minor.

In addition, major and minor chord progressions usually follow the primary cadences (harmonic touchstones) of the mode from which they are derived. Pieces tuned to major almost always end on a major **home-base** chord. This chord is usually referred to as **I** using Roman numerals.

The opposite is the case with songs in the minor key. Occasionally, however, classical pieces with a minor key surprise the listener by suddenly ending with a major third in the **home-base** or **I** chord. This unexpected switch gives the music a sudden boost. The classic term for this is Picardy third.

Create a minor from a major chord by lowering the 3rd, 6th and 7th degrees by one note.

Minor:

| **Moll** | **Dim**  | **Dur** | **Moll** | **Moll** | **Dur** | **Dur** |
| -------- | -------- | ------- | -------- | -------- | --------| ------- |



Major:

| **Dur**  | **Moll** | **Moll** | **Dur**  |  **Dur** | **Moll** | **Dim** |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | ---------| ------- |



Am Example:


|  **Am**  |  **B0** | **C** |  **Dm**  |  **Em**  |  **F**  | **G** |
| -------- | ------- | ----- | -------- | -------- | ------- | ----- |



Cm Example:

|  **Cm**  |  **D0** | **D#** |  **Fm**  |  **Gm**  |  **G#**  | **A#** |
| -------- | ------- | ------ | -------- | -------- | -------- | ------ |



**A minor scale can be achieved by lowering the 3rd, 6th and 7th major tones by one note**


```python
print(Scale.major)
```
_Console output >> P[0,2,4,5,7,9,11]_


```python
print(Scale.minor)

```
_Console output >> P[0,2,3,5,7,8,10]_


If you only want to change one chord to minor, lower the third note.

A melodic minor scale is created by raising the 6th and 7th notes of the minor scale.

```python
print(Scale.minor)

```
_Console output >> P[0,2,3,5,7,8,10]_


```python
print(Scale.melodicMinor)
```
_Console output >> P[0,2,3,5,7,9,11]_


Examples 7th minor scale of E (E3,F#3,G3,A3,B3,C4,D4,E4)

*   E3, G3, B3, D4 – m7 (add F#4 for m9)
    
*   F#3, A3, C4, E4 – Dim7 (add G4 for Dim9)
    
*   G3, B3, D4, F#4 – Maj7 (add A4 for Maj9)
    
*   A3, C4, E4, G4 – m7 (add B4 for m9)
    
*   B3, D4, F#4, A4 – m7 (add C5 for m9)
    
*   C4, E4, C4, B4 – Maj7 (add D5 for Maj9)
    
*   D4, F#4, A4, C5 – Major chord with minor7 – Dom7 (add E5 for Dom9)




## Melody

### Chords to Melody


One way is to create a chord progression, and than to find the melody in the chords.

|  **E3**  |  **D3** | **F3** |  **E3**  |
| -------- | ------- | ------ | -------- |
|    C3    |    B2   |   D3   |    C3    |
|    A2    |    G2   |   A2   |    G2    |



As mentioned before, the octave in Renardo is 2 steps above the usual, middle C is 5 not 3.

Lets do the chords with 93 bpm with A as Root note and minor scale:

```python
Clock.bpm = 93
Root.default=”A”
Scale.default=Scale.minor

# Chords:
chords = var([(0,2,4),(-1,1,3),(0,3,5),(-2,2,4)])
s1 >> swell(chords, oct=5, dur=4, sus=5)

# Hit the drums can help find a good melody:
b1 >> play("<X....X..X..[X.].X..><..o.><---->",sample=0)
```

The easiest way to start a melody is to take the highest notes of the chords.
However, you want to add some non-chord notes to your chord notes:

|  **E4**  |  **F4** | **D4** |  **F4**  |  **D4**  |  **G4**  | **E4** | **D4** |
| -------- | ------- | ------ | -------- | -------- | -------- | ------ | ------ |


```python
seq=[4,5,3,5,3,6,4,3]
s2 >> pulse(seq, oct=6, dur=[3,1,3,3,1,1,2,2])
```

---
### Melody to Chords


In this example we start with a melody in order to get suitable chords from it, here the melody.

|  **A3**  |  **B3** | **C4** |  **B3**  |  **E4**  |  **F4**  | **C4** | **G4** | **E4** | **D4** |
| -------- | ------- | ------ | -------- | -------- | -------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |


Let's set the tempo, the root and the scale:
```python
Clock.bpm = 93

Root.default=”A”

Scale.default=Scale.minor
```

The originating Melody:

If you can't remember the numbers on the scale list, use print(Scale.minor).

```python
seq=[0,1,2,1,4,5,2,6,4,3]
```

Synth:
```python
s1 >> saw(seq, dur=[2,1,1,4,3,1,1,1,1,1], formant=4, amplify=0.4)
```


The available chords (with 7th) for the notes played in the melody are as follows:

|  **G4**  |  **A4** | **B4** |  **C5**  |  **D5** | **E5** |  **F5**  |
| -------- | ------- | ------ | -------- | ------- | ------ | -------- |
|    E4    |    F4   |   G4   |    A4    |    B4   |   C5   |    D5    |
|    C4    |    D4   |   E4   |    F4    |    G4   |   A4   |    B4    |
|    A3    |    B3   |   C4   |    D4    |    E4   |   F4   |    G4    |



Here is a good example of a trip-hop-like track:


|  **E4**  |  **D4** | **E4** |  **E4**  |
| -------- | ------- | ------ | -------- |
|    C4    |    B3   |   C4   |    G4    |
|    A3    |    G3   |   A3   |    C4    |



Let's add the chords to the melody:
```python
chords = var([(0,2,4),(-1,1,3),(0,2,4),(-1,6,4)])
s2 >> keys(chords, oct=4, dur=4, shape=0.4)
```

And a drum hit:
```python
b1 >> play("<X....X..X..[X.].X..><..o.><---->", sample=0)
```


**Add a counter melody (arpeggio)**


Let's keep it simple and use the chord notes to play with the chords. With the counter melody we want to add a rhythm to the track.

As the 4th of the sequence in a 4-beat measure, we add the 2nd as shown here:
```python
chords = var([(0,2,4),(-1,1,3),(0,2,4),(-1,4,6)])
```

becomes
```python
seq2 = [0,2,4,2,-1,1,3,1,0,2,4,2,-1,4,6,4]
```

Now let's add another instrument that plays the counter melody:
```python
s3 >> karp(seq2, dur=1)
```

### Chords to Bassline


In the example below, the chord progression is based on A minor, while raising a root to a higher octave and lowering a root.


|  **G3**  |  **G3** |        |          |
| -------- | ------- | ------ | -------- |
|    E3    |    F3   |   G3   |    G3    |
|    C3    |    D3   |   E3   |    E3    |
|    A2    |    B2   |   C3   |    B2    |



Let's set the tempo, root and scale:
```python
Clock.bpm = 128
Root.default=”A”
Scale.default=Scale.minor
```

Here chords and synth:
```python
chords = var([(0,2,4,6),(1,1,3,6),(2,4,6),(1,4,6)])
s1 >> prophet(chords, oct=4, dur=4, sus=4)
```

The safe case is to use chord root notes as bass notes and lower those notes in the octave:

|  **A1**  |  **G1** | **C2** |  **E2**  |
| -------- | ------- | ------ | -------- |

```python
bassline1 = [0,-1,2,4]
```


Another way to create a bass line is to find notes within the chords (although the 7th can be tricky).

|  **A1**  |  **B1** | **C2** |  **B1**  |
| -------- | ------- | ------ | -------- |


You can also change the duration of the bass line to get a rhythmic component:

Use _dur=1_, _dur=[0.5,1]_, or _dur=[1,2,1]_ instead of _dur=4_.

Another option is to move the root note of a chord one step up the previous chord row.

With dur=1:
```python
bassline2=[0,0,0,-1,-1,-1,-1,2,2,2,2,-3,-3,-3,-3,0]
```

Or you use octave **oct** jumps:
```python
bassline3=[0,0,0,0,-1,-1,-1,-1,2,2,2,2,-3,-3,-3,-3]
```

with _dur=1_ and _oct=[3,3,4,3]_

Finally, a melody as a bass line:

|  **A1**  |  **G1** | **A1** |  **B1**  |  **A1**  |  **G1** | **G1** |  **A1**  |  **C2**  |  **C2** | **A1** |  **G1**  |  **E1**  |  **E1** | **F1** |  **G1**  |
| -------- | ------- | ------ | -------- | -------- | ------- | ------ | -------- | -------- | ------- | ------ | -------- | -------- | ------- | ------ | -------- |

```python
bassline4 = [0,-1,0,1,-1,-1,0,1,3,3,0,-1,-3,-3,-2,-1]
```



---
### Bassline to Chords


We'll start with tempo, root note, scale, and a simple bass line:
```python
Clock.bpm = 128
Root.default=”A”
Scale.default=Scale.minor
bassline=[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]
```

Now let's build chords along the minor chord, like: Am, Bm/A, G/A, Am.
```python
chords = var([(0,2,4),(1,3,5),(0,2,4),(-1,1,3),(0,2,4)])
```


Bm/A and G/A mean "above A" because the bass line still keeps A as the root of the chord.

The corresponding synth examples for bass and chords are:
```python
s1 >> jbass(bassline, oct=3, dur=0.5, shape=0.4) # Bass
s2 >> dirt(chords, oct=5, dur=[4,3,1,4,4], amplify=0.4) # Chords
```
Drums:
```python
b1 >> play("<V....V..><..o.><....k..d>←--[--]>", sample=var([4, 2], 16), amplify=0.5)
b2 >> play(var(["[ss]",".[ss]"]), amplify=0.5)
```

Some additional notes on a bass line:

**Only use one note at the time, as low frequency easy go “muddy”!**

## Scales and Modes

A musical scale, or scale, is technically defined as a series of ascending or descending unitary tones that form a range of notes that can be used to form a melody. Most of the scales in Western music correspond to a specific key. That is, a sequence of notes that is major or minor by default. This does not apply to the chromatic scale, which is a scale of all possible semitones in Western music. The whole tone scale is also a scale that consists of intervals that are two semitones apart.

Within a given key there are 7 notes in a single octave before reaching the 8th note, which has the same name as the first note and is twice the frequency. The seven notes have different intervals between adjacent notes. Sometimes it's a semitone (semitone), sometimes it's a whole tone (two semitones). The pattern of whole tone / semitone intervals that determine the notes of a key, starting with the note while the key is named, is whole-whole-half-whole-whole-whole-half. Within a single key, any of these seven notes could be used as the base note of an ascending sequence. Any such sequence created by starting with a different note in the key is a mode of that key, and each mode has a name. For example:

*   Ionian - begins with the "tonic"; the note for which the clef is named. In the key of C, the Ionic mode begins with C. This mode is the most common and is colloquially referred to as the "major scale". The pattern is WWHWWWH.
    
*   Dorian - starts with the next note higher in key than the tonic (D, in the key of C). WHWWWHW.
    
*   Phrygian - starts with the note that is a major third higher than the tonic (E). HWWWHWW.
    
*   Lydian - begins with the note that is a full fourth higher than the tonic (F). WWWHWWH.
    
*   Mixolydian - starts on the note that is a fifth higher than the tonic (G). WWHWWHW.
    
*   Aeolian - begins with the note a major sixth higher than the tonic (A). This mode is also very important in modern music and is known as the "natural minor scale". WHWWHWW.
    
*   Locrian - begins with the note a major seventh higher than the tonic (Bb). HWWHWWW.

### Using Scale


*   A scale is essentially a subset of the musical notes (pitches) between one note, e.g. C, and the same one an octave higher.
    
*   The starting note is the key of the scale.
    
*   Starting at C, these notes are:
    
*   This set of all the notes is called the chromatic scale.
    
*   If this was a Python list called chromatic, then chromatic[0] would return C, chromatic[1] would return C#, chromatic[2] would return D, and so until chromatic[11], which would return B.
    
*   Because each musical scale is a subset of these pitches, we can think of each scale as a list of indices for accessing pitches in the chromatic scale.
    

chromatic = [C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B]

| **C**  | **C#** | **D**  | **D#** | **E**  |  **F** | **F#** | **G**  | **G#** | **A**  | **A#** |**B(H)**|
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
|   0    |    1   |    2   |    3   |    4   |    5   |    6   |    7   |    8   |    9   |   10   |   11   |


*   To see a list of the scales available just run command print(Scale.names()).
    
*   By default, each player uses a globally accessibly default scale called Scale.default
    
*   This can be changed in 3 ways:
    

Simply assigning the scale object to Scale.default:
```python
Scale.default = Scale.minor
```

You can use the string name:
```python
Scale.default = "minor"
```

You can also use the "set" method, which allows more options:
```python
Scale.default.set("minor")
```

It is also possible to change the scale of players individually.

Force a player to use the minor scale:
```python
p1 >> pluck([0,1,2,3], scale=Scale.minor)
```

### Creating Beats


*   Try to add variations, modulations, and/or swing to your beats to keep it alive.
*   Variations are changes in the beat structure from one bar to another.
*   Modulations are effects on the entire drum set, or on single parts of the drum set.
*   Adjust some off notes to get a different dynamic within the beat, give your beat some swing.
*   Be careful not to get to dynamic, thus losing the drive through the bass drum.
